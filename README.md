# Multithreaded-webserver-main
The project aims to develop a highly efficient and responsive multithreaded web
server employing the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm. In this system,
the server is designed to handle concurrent client connections by employing a
multithreading approach. Each client request is processed by dedicated threads, and
the scheduling of these threads is determined by the SJF algorithm, which prioritizes
the threads based on their burst time. The utilization of multithreading allows the
server to handle multiple client requests simultaneously, enhancing the system's
overall responsiveness and throughput. SJF scheduling further optimizes the
execution order of threads, prioritizing shorter burst times to minimize response
times and improve the overall efficiency of the web server.
